### Live demo --> https://etch-a-sketch.roxannecodes.repl.co/
### The project:
- Goal: to create a canvas for users to draw on by dividing a grid into cells that change color upon the user "hovering" on them.
- Time-frame: ~ 9 hours to design and write my solution for this project challenge (in one sitting). https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project
- Skills:
 More advanced DOM manipulation methods to create and modify CSS grids using vanilla JS; Thorough application of event listeners and handlers.
