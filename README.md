### Live demo ðŸ‘‰https://roxannecodes.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/
### The project:
- Goal: to create a canvas for users to draw on by dividing a grid into boxes that change color upon the user dragging their mouse over them.

- default grid size of 16 x 16 is initially displayed, and the user is prompted to input their desired value upon pressing the refresh buttons. 

- Time-frame: ~ 9 hours to design and write my solution for this project challenge (in one sitting). https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

- Skills:
 More advanced DOM manipulation methods to create and modify CSS grid using vanilla JS; Application of event handlers and the target property
